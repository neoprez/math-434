              The Effects of Weather in the Production and Price Change

          <h4>The Effects of Weather in the Production and Price Change
            of Apples.
        </h4>
          <p>Find out how the change in weather affects the price
            and the production of apples. A project for my class
            <em>Introduction to Data Science</em> that
            I took at Lehman College.</p>
          <h3>Motivation</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>
            When I started this project, I wanted to know
            how much effect weather events, such as hurricanes
            and earthquakes, had over the price of all crops in the USA.
            However, due to it's complexity, I had to narrow it down
            to something much simpler. One day I read a
            <a href="http://www.harvesttotable.com/2009/07/how_to_grow_apples/">post</a>
            about how to grow apples. Within this post, the author
            says that <em>"Apples grow best where there is cold in winter,
              moderate summer temperatures, and medium to high humidity."</em>
              After reading this post, I got interested in knowing if what
              the author stated was true. Along with that, I wanted to incorporate
              my initial idea of knowing how the price of a crop changes
              depending on the weather. For this project, I want to know if
              there is a real correlation between the production of apples
              and the weather, as well as if there is a correlation between
              the price of the apples and the weather. To test my assumptions,
              I've used a correlation test. The code is written using <b>Python</b>
              and the graphs were created using <b>matplotlib</b>. The
              code is available on <a href="https://github.com/neoprez/math-434">Github</a>.
            <h3>The Datasets</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Seven (7) states
            that reported production of apples are evaluated in
            this project. These states are <b>California,
            Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia
            and Washington.</b>
            The dataset for the weather was collected from the
              <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets
  ">NOAA</a> website. This set contains the mean, max and min air
  temperatures from <b>2001</b> to <b>2010</b> for the 7 states mentioned above.
            The price information of apples was collected from <a href="http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/MannUsda/viewDocumentInfo.do;jsessionid=18BB3D5F6079AD6CFBCE006C0258C49E?documentID=1050">
            USDA ESMIS
          </a>. This dataset contains the annual summary of crop values
          by month, for each of the 7 states from <b>2001</b> to <b>2010</b>. The price of the apples
          is determined in pounds.

          <h3>Techniques</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>To have a better idea as to how the weather looked like from 2001
            to 2010 for the 7 states, I plotted the average weather data collected.
            In this graph, we can see how the temperatures oscillates between
            states. As expected lower temperatures for the period October-April
          and higher temperatures for the period May-August.</p>

            <img src="average_temp_from_2001-2010.png" class="img-responsive"/>
          </a>
          <p>Additionally, I plotted the price data for apples for each state
          from 2001 to 2010. In this graph we can see that some states did not
          produce apples or reported earnings during the warmer months. Also, we can
          see a dramatic reduction in the reported earnings for all
          states for the aforementioned months.</p>

            <img src="average-prices-2001-2010.png" class="img-responsive"/>
          </a>
          <p>The following graph reveals something interesting.
          Even though there is a high concentration in the production
          of apples on temperatures between 35 and 60 degrees,
          the price of apples increases slightly as temperature
          increases. After running a correlation test (price vs temperature),
          this slight increase can be noted as the result of the
          correlation test is of 0.224912643792. This result shows that the
          price of apples and temperature are positively correlated by a 22%.</p>

          <h3>Another Experiment</h3>
          <hr>
          In another experiment, I was trying to develop a model that will be
          able to predict whether a given place will be good for planting apples.
          For this model, I planned to use a logistic regression function, where
          the input will be the temperature and the output whether it produces
          or not.
